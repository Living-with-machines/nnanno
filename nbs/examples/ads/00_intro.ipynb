    "Deep learning has a reputation for being resource-heavy in multiple ways. In particular deep learning is associated with requiring lots of data and a large amount of compute resource. Although there is truth to this reputation, it is increasingly possible to use deep learning with smallish amounts of data and smallish amounts of compute. Since smallish is a little bit vague in these notebooks, the following constraints are observed:\n",
